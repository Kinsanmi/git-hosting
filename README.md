# React + TypeScript + Vite

## How to set up react using vite

1. Rather than the normal create-react-app and specifying the project names.  "npm create vite@latest"
2. Select react as the javascript library and select typescript
3. cd into your working repository and install dependencies.
4. vite provides a short-cut to run the development with "O + enter key". This starts up the dev, different from the usual npm start
